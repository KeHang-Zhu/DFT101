# DFT101

Performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations can often be a daunting task for many practitioners within the computational materials science field. The intricacies of the methods and the extensive nature of the documentation can be overwhelming and even intimidating for those new to the field. However, I believe that a more effective approach to learning these techniques is to begin by conducting basic calculations from scratch and progressively develop the code. Throughout this process, individuals will gain a deeper understanding of the purpose and impact of each command, enabling them to become more proficient in DFT applications.

This repo provides some simple examples that people may feel comfident when performing these tasks.




Some part of the projects are from Harvard AP275, Prof.Boris Kozinsky's lectures.
